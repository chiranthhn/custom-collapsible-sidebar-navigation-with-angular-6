To learn how to set up a project like this one, check out the [Apply multi-layout to an Angular app](http://keepgrowing.in/angular/apply-multi-layout-to-an-angular-app/) post.

This application serves two separate layouts - one provided on a landing page view, the other used on a dashboard view. There is a horizontal navigation and a footer on the landing page and a vertical navigation on a dashboard.

All views are complemented with Bootstrap classes.
